# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

This project is a **sentiment analysis application** built using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** and **Streamlit**. The app predicts whether a movie review expresses a **positive** or **negative** sentiment. It processes user-provided reviews and leverages the power of RNNs to analyze text sequences and provide accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Interactive Web App**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user interface.
- **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**: Users can input a movie review and get instant feedback on its sentiment.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a trained RNN.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays confidence scores for the sentiment classification.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Users enter a movie review into a text box on the Streamlit app.
2. **Processing**: The input is preprocessed (e.g., tokenization, padding) and passed to the trained RNN model.
3. **Prediction**: The model outputs whether the sentiment is **Positive** or **Negative**, along with confidence scores.
